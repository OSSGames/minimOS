# minimOS architecture

*Last update: 2018-05-29*

## Rationale

**minimOS** (or *mOS* for short) is intended as a **development platform** for computers 
with *modest resources*. Its main goals are **modularity** (you choose whatever set of 
features you need) and **portability**: originally targeted to computers based on 
[**6502** CPU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6502) 
and derivatives, either commercial or home-made by retrocomputing enthusiasts, might 
be equally ported for almost any CPU out there including, but not limited to, Motorola 
[**6800**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_6800), 
[**6809**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_6809) & 
[**680x0**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motorola_68000_series), 
Intel [**8080**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8080) /
[**8085**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intel_8085) /
[Zilog **Z80**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zilog_Z80) 
and the popular [**x86**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86), 
plus the ubiquitous [**ARM**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM_architecture).

These goals will define most of its design features.

# Background

## Inspiration from CP/M

The *portability* goal takes some inspiration from the once popular 
[**CP/M**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CP/M),
the then *de facto* standard OS for microcomputers. While the original target (65xx) is 
contemporary with those systems, present-day computing expectations lead to several 
differences.

Perhaps this achieved goal was the key to CP/M's success. This OS had three main components:

- **BIOS** (Basic I/O system, *hardware dependent*)
- **BDOS** (Basic Disk OS)
- **CCP** (Console Command Processor)

Unlike the [**BIOS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BIOS), 
which was providedÂ *customised* by the computer's maker, 
all the remaining components were **generic**, as supplied by 
[Digital Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Research). 
Of course, other commands or the *application software* were run atop of this, probably by 
temporarily *replacing the CCP* for increased available RAM, as this 
was a **single task**, single user OS. As soon as the task was completed, the *shell* (CCP) 
was reloaded and the user was prompted for another command.

Alas, this scheme is not complete: usually, these components were provided on some kind of mass-storage
media (often [*diskettes*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floppy_disk)) 
that had to be *loaded* into RAM somehow, as no CPU has any means to execute code *directly* from 
[**secondary memory**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Auxiliary_memory). 
Thus, a small piece of **ROM** or any other *non-volatile 
[**primary** memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_memory)* 
was needed in order to load and run the Operating System. This was often a 
[**bootloader**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bootstrapping#Computing) 
(generically known as 
[**firmware**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firmware)) 
whose main purpose, besides the initial setup and perhaps some hardware tests 
([*POST, Power-On Self-Test*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power-on_self-test))
was merely copying those three files in RAM and ordering the CPU to jump at their code. Obviously, 
this firmware was part of the computer's hardware, and had nothing to do with CP/M, save 
for being designed to boot from such system files. 

Apart from such firmware design, having an **Intel 8080** CPU or compatible (the only one 
initially supported by CP/M) and at least **16 KiB RAM** *starting at address $0*\* (plus some 
kind of **disk drive** for the DOS to work on) were the only requisites to any computer 
maker to have a **CP/M compatible** machine. With its notable software base, CP/M was *the* 
choice for many computer makers, at least in the office environment.

\*) A quick *hardware* note: since the i8080 CPU starts executing code *from address 0*, 
some **non-volatile** ROM is expected to be accesible at that address. But CP/M *needs* RAM there, 
thus some means to *switch off* ROM access from the bottom of the address map (once 
the firmware has done its task, of course) has to be provided to achieve CP/M compatibility... 
unless you want to *manually* program the initial RAM bytes via toggle-switches! Anyway, 
such a simple [*bank-switching*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bank_switching) 
feature was easily implemented, as demonstrated by CP/M's sheer popularity.

Back in the day, the **I/O** capabilites of computers were rather limited: assume a *keyboard*, an *output device*
(could be a text CRT screen, but a [*teletype*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleprinter) 
would do) and/or a *printer*, plus some *mass-storage* devices, 
and you were set. Thus, the concept of modular 
[device **drivers**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Device_driver) 
as separate pieces of software was not relevant, and adapting your system to different 
peripherals meant the aforementioned **BIOS customisation** -- it wasn't *that* hard, anyway.

After the hayday of CP/M came the *x86-based* 
[**IBM PC**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IBM_Personal_Computer) 
running [**MS-DOS**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS-DOS), 
itself pretty much inspired by CP/M, although the BIOS was somehow integrated into the firmware,
at least in an OS-independent fashion. For compatibility reasons, a 
[**jump table**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branch_table) 
was provided for easily calling BIOS routines, no matter their actual 
locations in ROM; for additional performance, some software *skipped* this jump table, 
leading to a 
[plethora of incompatibilities](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Influence_of_the_IBM_PC_on_the_personal_computer_market) 
whenever a *different from IBM's (copyrighted) BIOS* was used, but this soon ceased 
to be a problem, thanks to the development of highly compatible BIOSes thru 
[*clean room* design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clean_room_design) techiniques, 
running on highly standardised PC *clones* of widespread use. ***The rest is history...***

## The home-computer market

On the other hand, the late seventies witnessed the birth of an unexpected computer 
market: the [*home computer*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Home_computer) 
which, despite the performance impairment, made computing affordable for the masses.

But bereft of the portability/standardisation features of CP/M (and later MS-DOS) machines, 
these were **closed, incompatible systems**, each platform gathering its base of loyal 
users. Despite this diversity, many systems became quite popular indeed: in USA, the 
[**TRS-80**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TRS-80),
the [**Commodore PET**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_PET), 
the [**Atari 400/800**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_8-bit_family), 
and the [**Apple \]\[**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_II); 
at the other side of the pond, the 
[**ZX Spectrum**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZX_Spectrum),
the *powerful* [**BBC Micro**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BBC_Micro) 
(especially in UK schools) and, a bit later, the 
[**Amstrad CPC**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amstrad_CPC)... plus the 
[**Commodore 64**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) 
(and its predecessor [**VIC-20**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_VIC-20)
) **anywhere** in the world, to mention the most relevant.

Despite their alleged technological advantage, the *Japanese* were off from this 
fierce price war but anyway they tried to make an *standardised* platform for it: the ill-fated 
[**MSX**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX) 
systems had some popularity in Japan, but much less in Europe and almost *zero* in America.

Substituting home cassette players for (then expensive) disk drives, these systems had 
a relatively ample ROM with not only the essential firmware and *kernel/BIOS* (sort-of), 
but usually featured a 
[**BASIC language interpreter**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC), 
thus after booting (in just *a couple of seconds!*) one could simply 
**start typing programs**. *Many of us were taught Computer Programming (leading to 
formal education in Computer Science) this way...*

A pretty odd exception to this rule (in the UK) was the 
[**Jupiter ACE**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jupiter_Ace), 
somewhat related to 
[*Sinclair*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sinclair_Research) 
computers, but meant to be programmed... in 
[**Forth**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forth_(programming_language)). 
This rather limited (1 KiB RAM + 2 KiB *VRAM*) machine 
played little role into the troubled waters of home computers, but made a point on the 
**extreme efficiency** of the little known Forth language.

Eventually, these home computers evolved into 16 or even 32-bit processors, like the 
[Apple IIgs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_IIGS), 
[Atari ST](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atari_ST) &
[Commodore Amiga](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga),
although they were somewhat less popular as regular x86 PCs became less and less expensive.

# Generic *minimOS* architecture

## Overview

At first glance, **minimOS** architecture might look similar to that of CP/M,
but there are significant differences. Have a look at this graph:

![minimOS architecture](mOS-arch.jpeg)

Apparently, the **firmware** looks like the generic term for CP/M's *BIOS* -- together with
the device **drivers**, which were implemented via *customisation*.

On the other hand, the **Kernel/API** seems certainly related to the *BDOS*, as is
hardware-independent and providing the only interface *application software* is supposed
to use... This component is probably the 
**closest one to CP/M's design**, in both form and function.

However, unlike CP/M's *BIOS*, minimOS' firmware (as of 2018-05-29) has
**no I/O capabilities**, being restricted to **Kernel instalation/configuration** chores,
plus providing a **standard interface to some hardware-dependent features**(say,
*power management*). As this OS is intended to run on a **wide spectrum of machines**,
from a simple embedded system to a *quasi-full-featured* desktop computer,
**there is no guarantee of I/O device availability** at such low level.
You can think of this as a ***Hardware Abstraction Layer***

On second thought, in case of a *Kernel and/or driver failure*, it would be nice to have 
an *emergency* I/O channel available for **debugging purposes**, provided the hardware 
allows it. For instance, a *Commodore 64* **has** a 40x25 text screen starting at $0400 
which could be easily used by debuggers, after a simple VIC-II initialisation. It does
have, of course, a **keyboard** for human input, too. Even if a 
particular computer lacks such convenient devices, a **suitable driver** provided by its 
*custom* kernel could "announce" its availability to the firmware, for its simple 
firmware I/O to work thru it. These won't be as reliable as the built-in devices in 
heavily crashed environments, but it's better than nothing. *The concept of separate 
**firmware drivers** has been considered*, but deemed too complicated. Actual 
implementation might just use a regular driver in firmware space, with its *unused*
header as I/O routines will be directly called. *As long as the header address is
provided into the configuration list at `drvrs_ad`, it might be used by the regular
kernel too*. 

## Firmware

This is intended as the **device-dependent** part of minimOS (the kernel being
*device-independent*). Formerly consisted of several files, each one serving a
particular architecture; however, the chore of copying every improvement on *each*
file was aliviated via a **fully-*modular* approach**: the `template` file (or any
particular machine's firmware, for that matter) will consist in just **a bunch of
`#include`s** for *small* code chunks on the `modules` folder. Different machines
may then use a different chunk for a particular feature, or just suppress it.

Please note that some of these chunks may be as short as two or three lines on code!
However, this make sense as ther might be implementation changes for some simple
operations, like e. g. the *jiffy counter* size.

A similar **modular**
approach has been used for **firmware variables**, *statically* assigned before kernel's
`sysvars`. After including the regular `template.h`, a particular machine may add
any other variables as needed. 

### The *administrative Kernel*

This is the **firmware's API**, originally intended to be used by the Kernel only --
although a standard interface is provided for standard apps, even if it's not really
needed for the 65(C)02 version.

Main available functions are for `INSTALL`ing the Kernel's *jump table*, and setting the
IRQ, BRK and NMI routines -- usually will be called by the Kernel at startup time.
The mechanism for **kernel patching** is also supplied, and from 0.6 version on
it does provide a *recovery
setting* -- just a NULL pointer as the supplied jump table (for `INSTALL`)
or routine address (for individual function `PATCH`). The firmware will take care of a 
pointer to the last installed *kernel **jump table***
for this matter.

On the other hand, passing a NULL pointer to any interrupt-setting function will simply
return the original pointer. This might be deprecated as the standard interface for
*patching* kernel functions will also return the *previous* address, thus
allowing both **head and tail patching**, like this:

**Install routine** (6502 version)
```
    LDA #>patch           ; pointer to new code
    LDX #<patch
    STX kerntab           ; store parameter word
    STA kerntab+1
    LDY #my_function_id   ; kernel function to be patched
    _ADMIN(PATCH)         ; install my routine
    LDX kerntab           ; get old pointer
    LDA kerntab+1
    STX my_pointer        ; store it at a known address
    STA my_pointer+1
```

(65816 version)
```
    LDA #patch            ; pointer to new code (or head_patch)
    STA kerntab           ; set as parameter
    LDY #my_function_id   ; kernel function to be patched
    _ADMIN(PATCH)         ; install my routine
    LDA kerntab           ; get old pointer
    STA my_pointer        ; store it in a known address
```

**Head and/or tail patch code** (6502 version)
```
patch:
; *** here comes the HEAD patching code ***
    JSR old_call          ; *** only for tail-patching code ***
; *** here comes the TAIL patching code ***
    _EXIT_OK              ; proper API exit *** only for tail-patching code ***
old_call:
    JMP (my_pointer)      ; call original routine (will return to tail-patch or caller) 
    
```

(65816 version)
```
patch:
; *** here comes the HEAD patching code ***
    PHK                   ; will return to this bank *** tail code only ***
    PEA patch_code        ; proper return address for RTI *** tail code only ***
    PHP                   ; as requested by RTI *** tail code only ***
    JMP (my_pointer)      ; call original routine (will return to tail-patch or caller) 
patch_code:
; *** here comes the TAIL patching code ***
    _EXIT_OK              ; proper API exit *** tail code only ***
```

Please note that, unlike the *generic* Kernel, this *administrative Kernel* is **not**
patchable. The firmware will keep a table in RAM for the kernel's vector, sized as 
defined by `API_SIZE`.

## Device Drivers (0.6 version)

As an essential feature of such device-agnostic OS, minimOS **driver architecture** has 
been carefully crafted for **versatility**. The details may vary depending on the CPU 
in use, but in any case they'll bear a **header** containing this kind of information:

- A device **ID** (currently 128-255, as *logical* devices use up to 127)
- A **feature mask** indicating the availability of some of the following
- Pointers to **initialisation** and **shutdown** routines (mandatory)
- Pointers to ***block* Input** and **Output** routines (when available)
- Pointer to a **configuration** routine (when available)
- Pointer to a **status report** routine (when available)
- Pointer to an **Asynchronous Interrupt Handler** (called *by request*, if enabled)
- Pointer to a **Periodic Interrupt Handler** (called every "n" *jiffy* interrupts, if enabled)
- **Frequency** value for the *periodic* task described above (the *n* value for the above)
- Pointer to a **description *C-string*** in human-readable form
- Number of ***dynamically allocated* bytes**, if loadable *on-the-fly*
- *Offset* to data relocation table (only if the above is **not zero**)

A last-minute change in 0.6 is the **block-oriented I/O**. This was foreseen on older
versions, but drivers were *character-oriented*. This also leaves room for separate
**configuration** and **status report** features, previously integrated within block I/O.
Note that, for compatibility reasons, *the Kernel still provides legacy **character**-
oriented I/O*, as mere interfaces setting a fixed single-byte *block size* prior to
calling the generic block routines.

The primitive **event management** this far expected certain *control characters*
(^C for `SIGTERM`, ^Z for `SIGSTOP`, etc) to be received and processed via `CIN`.
Since managing these events *within a block transfer* seems unconvenient to say the
least, the new approach does manage them **thru the *legacy* `CIN` routine**, which is
anyway expected to be used for human iteraction. Note that current (0.6) `READLN`
impementation does use `CIN` internally, thus event-savvy.

Of special interest are the **interrupt routines**. The (now unified) **periodic** queue handles
those tasks at *multiples* of the **jiffy** IRQ period; while **5 ms** is the *recommended*  
value, the actual timing **cannot be guaranteed**. Plus, the ocassional *interrupt masking* 
when entering 
[critical sections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_section) may cause further 
delays. This mechanism is particularly suited to  
replace the [**daemons**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daemon_(computing)) 
commonly seen on UNIX-like systems, perhaps with better responsiveness (quite an asset on 
low-spec machines) or even with no form of **multitasking** (which is, in any 
case, another *driver*) available! On the other hand, for those cases of obviously 
**infrequent** tasks (disk auto-mount, long-lasting timers), a suitably larger *frequency* 
parameter is to be used.

Older versions (before 0.6) had the **periodic tasks** separated into *jiffy* and *slow* 
interrupt tasks, with no *frequency* parameter whatsoever, being complete responsability of 
the task to count whatever *ticks* (jiffy interrupts) must wait in order to call the routine.
Within the current **unified periodic queue** (and assuming a *recommended* **4 ms** IRQ 
period) a *frequency* value of 250 would be equivalent 
to the older *slow* interrupt task (4*250=1000 ms), while the standard **1** value will 
serve 
just like the old *jiffy* task. In case a driver needs *both* the jiffy and slow interrupt tasks, 
code for the former shoud handle an internal **counter** for the appropriate delay, *as was already 
being done for may interrupt tasks not requiring being executed at **every** single jiffy IRQ*. 
On such cases, the unified interrupt task may start (in 6502 fashion) like this:

```
    DEC delay          ; some internal counter
    BNE fast_task      ; not expired, just execute jiffy task
        LDA #max_delay ; number of jiffys to be executed before the slow task
        STA delay
        JSR slow_task  ; execute slow task...
fast_task:             ; ...and continue with the usual jiffy task
```

For instance, in a system with 4 ms jiffy IRQ, a driver executing a periodic task 
**every 20 ms** 
*and* a slow task every full second, would use `frequency = 5` and `max_delay = 50`. 
A similar piece of code had to be used with "jiffy" tasks that hadn't to be 
executed every periodic IRQ, as mentioned above.

Please note that while frequencies are stated as 16-bit integers, `LOWRAM` option will 
take the LSB *only*.

Another improvement to the old method is the possibiliy of **temporarily disabling a certain 
interrupt task** when not needed, for better system performance (and, of course, **re-enabling** it 
at any time, when needed). ***API functions** will be provided to **enable/disable** a particular task, 
modify its **frequency** value or simply **checking** its current settings*.

On the other hand, with *asynchronous interrupts* it's still worth keeping them in a 
*separate queue* for **lower interrupt latency**. *Frequency* is meaningless here, but the idea 
of **enabling/disabling** them at will remains interesting. Such on-the-fly check adds very little 
overhead, thus way worth it.

Actual implementation may vary, but probably the most efficient way is having separate 
**interrupt queues** (one for each kind: periodic/async) filled up at boot time *if* 
a driver provides such kind of interupt task *and* was succesfully initialised. Please note that 
this system was designed with the (rather simple) interrupt system of 65xx processors in mind. 
*Hardware with more sophisticated interrupt management could use more 
queues to match their capabilities*. In any case, 
whenever the [ISR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_handler) 
is called, if a *periodic* interrupt was the cause, the *periodic* queue will be scanned, 
calling each entry sequentially (ditto for the *slow* queue, whenever some amount of 
jiffy IRQs happened). For the **asynchronous tasks**, as similar procedure may be used, 
but each task must return an *error code* signaling whether the IRQ was **acknowledged** 
by that handler or not. This code **may or may not** be ignored by the ISR, depending on 
performance considerations or the chance of simaltaneous interrupts.

*I/O routines* need little explanation, now that **block** transfers are the
standard form. Old *character-oriented* code will now need to integrate a loop for
repeatedly executing the single byte transfer. Note that drivers lacking input and/or
output capabilities **must** provide anyway a pointer to a valid *error routine*, as
the MSB might be checked in some implementations. 

At boot time, the *initialisation* routine of each registered driver is **unconditionally** 
called -- if not needed, must point to an existing *Return from Subroutine* instruction. 
Upon exit, this routine must return an **error flag** indicating whether the driver was 
succesfully initialised or not (e.g. device not present), the latter condition making it 
**unavailable** for further I/O operation. Similarly, at shutdown/reboot every *shutdown* 
routine will be called, although any error condition makes little sense now, thus is not 
required.

### Static vs. *Dynamic* Drivers

As of 2018-05-29, drivers **cannot be loaded *on-the-fly*** (*dynamic*), 
being **assembled together** with the Kernel, firmware etc. 
The problem is in *driver variables*, which are **statically allocated**. 
*Future versions will allow loading drivers from mass storage, even on a 
running system **without rebooting***. For this to be achieved, *dynamic allocation* of 
variable space is needed, thus a parameter in driver header asks for a certain memory 
size. Details for passing the allocated space *pointer* to the asking driver are TBD,
however in 65xx architectures has been dismissed the idea of *pointing `sysptr`* to the 
beginning of allocated space, prior to any interrupt task execution, as this will 
**dramatically impair performance**, together with the use of *Indirect indexed 
addressing* instead of faster *absolute* addressing, indexed or not.
 
Alternatively, a *relocation* scheme (**not yet used**) will be used for *much*
better runtime performance; I no longer see any problem for the **65816**, as 
*Direct Page* does not need to be moved or even used, except for the
*globally system reserved* `sysptr` and `systmp`. 

Sample code for *driver variable **relocation*** could be as follows (wrote in
**16-bit** memory/indexes in 65816-fashion for simplicity).
*This will be done upon `DR_INST` call* and
a similar scheme could be used for *generic code relocation* as issued by `LOADLINK`.

We assume `da_ptr` points to the driver's header, as usual during install.

```
; first let us set up some pointers
    LDY #D_MEM         ; how much dynamic memory is asked?
    LDA (da_ptr), Y
    BNE dd_end         ; static driver, nothing to do here
; *** missing here is reserving dynamic memory for the driver, assume pointer at dynmem ***
        LDY #D_DYN         ; otherwise get offset to relocation table
        LDA (da_ptr), Y
        CLC
        ADC da_ptr         ; get absolute pointer
        STA dyntab         ; use as local pointer
        LDY #0             ; reset counter
; all set, let us convert the variable references
dyd_rel:
            LDA (dyntab), Y    ; any more to convert?
                BEQ dd_end         ; no, all done
            CLC
            ADC da_ptr         ; yes, compute actual location of address
            STA tmptr          ; store temporary pointer
            LDA (tmptr)        ; this is the generic address to be converted
            EOR #$4000         ; *** assume generic addresses start @ $4000 and no more than 16k is used ***
; We can assume C clead here
            ADC dynmem         ; the location of this driver's variables
; the above value could be directly read from an X-indexed array, saving one local
            STA (tmptr)        ; address is corrected!
            INY                ; go for next offset (assume 16-bit indexes)
            INY
            BRA dyd_rel
dd_end:
```

### Device IDs

IDs *were* chosen in a random fashion, but they're likely to be grouped into batches
of generic devices, like this:

- `lr0-lr7` = 128-135, **Low Resources** (for use within `LOWRAM` option)
- `rd0-rd7` = 128-135, **Reseved Drivers** (for multitasking, windowing, filesystem, etc.)
- `as0-as7` = 232-239, *Asynchronous* Serial
- `ss0-ss7` = 240-247, *Synchronous* Serial (like **SS22**)
- `ud0-ud7` = 248-255, **User Devices** (255 *might* be reserved)

Thus, drivers would include any ID in the generic range, and the
OS will try to find a place for him, perhaps with another suitable ID. Since
there could be up to 8 **asynchronous serial** devices `as0` to `as7`, corresponding
to IDs 232 to 239, **most** if not all of these drivers would be supplied with
a fixed ID of 232, no matter whether driving a 6551, 6850, 16C550 or bit-banged VIA;
upon install, the kernel would try to use the 232 entry. If busy, try everyone else up
to 239; if no free entry is found, complain as `BUSY`, otherwise install it. Might try
first with the supplied ID first (232-239) just in case.*

As of 2017-10-23, a new
`MUTABLE` option switches on this feature, which will take (yet) another 256-byte array
from `sysvars.h`.

About **logical** device IDs, as of 2018-05-29 only three are supported:

- **#0** as the (task-defined or global) **default** device (like UNIX's `stdin` & `stdout`)
- **#126** as **`DEV_RND`** (still under development)
- **#127** as **`DEV_NULL`** (more like UNIX's `/dev/zero`)

Device IDs in the range 1...63 are intended as **window** numbers, while 64 and up could
be assigned to open **file handlers**.

### Multitasking

An unconventional feature (for the sake of modularity) is that multitasking is
**implemented as a 'device' driver**. This driver will supply
the **scheduler** as a periodic `D_POLL` task (usually at *frequency* 1, although *soft*
6502 implementations may use a longer quantum) while the `D_INIT` routine will
**`PATCH` the existing *task-handling* functions**. `GET_PID` might not need to be
patched, as long as the scheduler makes use of the supplied `SET_CURR` function in
order to report the running PID (and architecture) to the OS.  

## Kernel/API

*to be done*

### Kernel patching

Kernel's API functions may be patched (except on the `LOWRAM` version). From 0.6, the
patching function (see *firmware* for details) provides the *previous* address,
thus allowing both **head and/or tail patching**. By passing a NULL pointer, any
*patched* function may be restored to the **originally supplied** one. You can also
unpatch the whole API, restoring it to the last installed full Kernel!  

## Access privileges

This is always a tough question, as there are some *psychological* reasons against a robust, **highly protected** system -- 
it may lead to **buggier** user software under the *fake security* impression that userland crashes won't affect the *rest* 
of the system... but there are certain situations where adequate protection is **a must**. Thus, by concept, minimOS *neither 
requires nor prevent protection techniques*. Development is made with *cleanliness* and *functional separation* in mind, but 
access privileges are just **recommended paths**, as 65xx CPUs have no protection facilities whatsoever, and **may be skipped** 
altogether if *performance concerns* require so. The aforementioned functional separation would allow other CPUs with privilege 
support to strictly enforce such "correct" access procedures.

The arrows in the previous graphic tell the *expected* calls between components. In a nutshell:

- **User apps** may just call the *Kernel/API*
- **Kernel** will use *drivers* and *firmware* functions, but **not** the *hardware*
- **Drivers** will interact with *hardware*, either directly or thru *firmware*
- **Firmware** is of course *hardware-specific*, but may call some *Kernel* functions

Eagle-eyed readers may have noticed the **yellow fringing** around the *apps-to-kernel* arrow... while user apps are not 
*expected* to call the Firmware *directly*, there is nothing preventing it. Actually, a "plain" 6502 may do it without 
effort, as the firmware's [ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) is pretty much the same as 
the Kernel's (call via `JSR` and ending in `RTS`). The 65816 makes it more difficult, as the Kernel uses a different 
interface (call via `COP` which must end in **`RTI`**) while the Firmware
is expected to be called *from bank zero* (where the 
Kernel & drivers must reside); but anyway, a **wrapper** is now provided for enabling the user apps to **directly** call
the firmware via `JSL` (from any bank)... *if you know what you're doing* (register sizes, etc)

The desired *cleanliness* is responsible for the creation of some *apparently unneeded* Kernel functions (`TS_INFO`, `RELEASE`, 
`SET_CURR`...) that will be discussed in due time, particularly affecting **multitasking** implementation.

Note that *future* optimisation options will render kernel & firmware calls as **direct `JSR` calls**
(or some suitable 65816 replacement, including `PLP:RTL` instead of `RTI`) removing
the need for *jump tables* and the time-consuming interface that was needed for **binary compatibility**.

### Task context

This is an architecture-dependent issue, but will usually include:

- Standard *per task* Input and Output device, allowing easy **redirection**
- Some available **space** for the user task, doesn't need to be allocated
- Probably an indication of available user space. *This could be updated with the **actually** used bytes from that space*.
- **Local variables** for kernel functions (should *not* be touched by user code)
- **Kernel parameters** for function calling
- **System reserved variables** which, at least on 65xx machines, *may* be used harmlessly but would certainly change
upon interrupts or context switches.

Depending of the CPU used, this context can be totally or partially stored in **zero-page** (for 65xx and 68xx families), 
**registers** (680x0) or some appropriately pointed RAM area. Together with the 
[stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_\(abstract_data_type\)) area, this will be saved upon **context switches** 
(typically under *multitasking*) with probably the *system reserved variables* as a notable exception.
NMIs should preserve that too for total **transparency**

Some hardware may make this area **protected** from other processes. Even on 65xx architectures,***bank-switching** the zero-page and stack* areas will yield a similar effect, while greatly improving **multitasking** performance.

## The LOWRAM option

With an eye into **microcontrolers**, *minimOS* should be able to run on the most humble
devices. Most interestingly, application (source) code for these devices should run
**unmodified** on suitable bigger machines, for ease of development. With the
inspiration coming from an *exposure time meter* project (using a 650**3** and an
otherwise nearly-useless 6810 IC (**128-byte SRAM**), plus also from the attractive
**6301/6303** Hitachi MCUs, it is reasonable to design a *reduced feature set* with
particularly **low RAM usage**.

Initially devised as a *separate fork*, 0.5.x version gave birth to the `LOWRAM`
version. In order to reduce RAM usage, this option produces the following changes:

- Non-patchable kernel calls
- No memory management (besides zeropage/**context** area)
- Reduced number of available drivers
- Compact driver ID range (no *sparse* arrays)
- No multitasking option
- No windowing system option
- No filesystem

As there is no RAM to load programs (or drivers) on, there will not be any *relocation*
features.

Newer options are due for 0.6, like:

- replacing generic calls with direct JSRs (**DONE via the `FAST_API` and `FAST_FW` options**)**
- using I/O arrays in ROM (*should be a configuration file matter*)
- *adding* an array for driver enabling (whether `D_INIT` succeeded)

and many more *(to be completed)*

*more coming soon*
