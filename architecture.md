# minimOS architecture

*Last update: 2017-05-07*

## Rationale

**minimOS** (or *mOS* for short) is intended as a development platform for computers 
with modest resources. Its main goals are **modularity** (you choose whatever set of 
features you need) and **portability** (originally targeted to computers based on 6502 
CPU and derivatives, either commercial or home-made by retrocomputing enthusiasts, might 
be equally ported for almos any CPU out there including, but not limited to, Motorola 
6800, 6809 & 680x0, Intel 8080/8085/Zilog Z80 and the popular x86).

These goals will define most of its design features.

## Architecture

The *portability* goal takes some inspiration from the once popular **CP/M**, the then 
*de facto* standard OS for microcomputers. While the original target (65xx) is 
contemporary with those systems, present-day computing expectations lead to several 
differences.
