## minimOS port for 65C816

Besides regular '816 code, this will **allow executing 65(C)02 code** in *native* mode,
although the Rockwell extensions (RMB/SMB/BBR/BBS) are *not* supported. 8-bit code is
restricted to run in *bank zero*, also.

Since this port is **interoperable** with the 6502 family, all code is available thru
[the original minimOS-65 version](../../), usually with filenames ending in *16*.
Specific support for this CPU is included since
[version **0.5.1**](https://github.com/zuiko21/minimOS/tree/0.5.1) and later.
