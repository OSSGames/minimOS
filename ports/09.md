# minimOS·09

*minimOS* port for the **Motorola 6809** and its *Hitachi* CMOS derivative (**6309**).
As these interesting CPUs, unlike the 6502/65816 breed, are **not** interoperable with other members
of the [Motorola 6800 series](../63.md), they need their own specific port.

All **minimOS·09** code *will be available* on [a separate repository](https://github.com/zuiko21/minimOS-09).
