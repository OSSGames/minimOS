##minimOS port for 65C816

Besides regular '816 code, this will **allow executing 65(C)02 code** in *native* mode, although the Rockwell extensions (RMB/SMB/BBR/BBS) are *not* supported.

Since this port is **interoperable** with the 6502 family, all code is available thru [the original minimOS-65 version](../../), usually with filenames ending in *16*.
